            China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown
            cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. Within days,
            44 patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported to WHO
            by Chinese authorities. Of these 44 cases, 11 were reported to be
            severely ill, an early indication that this disease was potentially
            more serious than common illnesses such as seasonal influenza.
            Fast-forward several months, millions have been infected, hundreds
            of thousands have died, and the global economy is in a state of
            distress unseen since the Great Depression. Despite these alarming
            statistics, many have risen to the challenge of better understanding
            this disease. Sites such as

            present information that serves to better understand both the
            current state and the spread of covid-19. Using the data made
            publicly available by these sites, I have created web applications
            to explore covid-19 data both within the US and around the world.
            The code behind these sites may be examined by clicking the Github
            button. Links to each of the sites are included further below.
